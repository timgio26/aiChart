# 📊 LLM Chart Interpretation Web App

A web-based tool for evaluating how Large Language Models (LLMs) interpret chart images using mini-VLAT and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting.

> 🧪 **This application was developed as part of a thesis project** exploring the visualization literacy of LLMs and their ability to reason over chart-based data.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This app supports academic research into the capabilities of LLMs to interpret visual data. It allows users to upload chart images and compare how different models respond to structured prompts, with or without CoT reasoning. The evaluation is based on the mini-VLAT framework.
